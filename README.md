# ImageProcessingProject

This was a fun project, which one coleague and I made for Introduction to Image Processing course, on Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad.
The goal was to make a program which applies filters to a specific image, using basic libraries(mostly Numpy) and a lot of math.

The  project consists of two .py files. One of those files (filters.py) contains functions which are doing the processing of the image.
In the other file(diy_instagram.py), UI is created and functions from filters.py are connected to buttons and sliders on the UI.

Also, in the repository I included a few .tif images for anyone willing to try out running our project app.

Obviously there is a lot of room for improvement. The project has many bugs we are aware of, and probably even more those that we aren't aware of.
Having that in mind, I think we actually did a nice job with this project, considering the fact that we spent a few weeks of occasional programming.

Thansks for reading :)
